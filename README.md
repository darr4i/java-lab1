# Matrix Operations in Java

This project implements basic matrix operations in Java, including:
1. XOR operation (`A ^ B`) between two matrices of type `long`.
2. Processing the resulting matrix to calculate:
   - The sum of the largest elements in the odd-numbered columns.
   - The sum of the smallest elements in the even-numbered columns.

## Requirements

- Java 8 or higher

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name

3. Compile the project using javac:

    ```bash
    javac MatrixOperations.java

4. Run the program using java:

    ```bash
    java MatrixOperations

## Example Output

```
Matrix C (A ^ B):
17 13 15 9 
9 13 13 1 
1 13 13 9 
9 13 15 17 

Computation result: 46
